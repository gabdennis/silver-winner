 Special thanks to the University of Alberta for providing the dataset used in the project.

 ### What is Renewable Energy?
 It is described as energy that is derived from natural resources that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed (United Nations). According to the Government of Canada, renewable energy sources accounted for 16.9% of Canada's total primary energy supply.
 ```
Total primary energy supply (TPES) = Production + Imports – Exports + Stock changes

Moving water is by far the most important form of renewable energy source in Canada, providing 61.7 percent of Canada’s electricity generation in 2022 with Canada being the 3rd largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world.
